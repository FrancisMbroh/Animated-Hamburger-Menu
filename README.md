# Francis Mbroh - Animated Hamburger Menu - CSS HTML NO JS

Hi I'm Francis Mbroh. I'm a web developer who is avid to seeking solutions to everyday problems.
I wanted to create a hamburger with animation and I just did it. I believe being able to solve problems pivot on taking actions.
Feel comfy traversing my repositoriesðŸ˜Š.
